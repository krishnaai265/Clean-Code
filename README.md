# Clean Code for Java Project.  
-----------------------

## Clean Code

Clean code is subjective and every developer has a personal take on it. There are some ideas that are considered best practice and what constitutes as clean code within the industry and community, but there is no definitive distinction. And I donâ€™t think there ever will be.

## Advantages of Clean Code

* Clearness
* Best Practices
* Easier to Test
* Lower Maintenance Burden
* Simplicity
* Consistency
* Cost Savings

## How to setup: 

1. Clone the project. 
2. Download & Install Eclipse.
3. Open Project.
4. Run Unit Test Cases.
